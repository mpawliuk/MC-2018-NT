\begin{exercise} Find a subset of $51, 57, 34, 25, 46, 41, 25, 56, 64, 70$ with sum $151$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Make a password with someone in the class using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Any information you agree on must be written on the board.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Find the smallest superincreasing sequence possible that starts with $1$ and has 10 terms. Assume that the sum of the first $n$ terms is greater or equal to the sum of the first $n-1$ terms.  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Create a challenging subset sum problem for someone in the class \ldots and solve someone else's subset sum problem.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Show Mike's Folly for $\mathbb{Z}_11$ by finding an element with order $10$, one with order $5$, and one with order $2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Explore Mike's Folly by finding the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ that have order $\phi(n)$. Check this for various primes $p$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} (Vishnu's house of morbid curiosities and grotesque logic.) Mike's folly can be incredibly false. Show that in $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$ all its elements have order $1$ or $2$, but $\phi(n) = 8$. $\mathbb{Z}_{80}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{120}$ also have very low maximum order, but large $\phi(n)$.
\end{exercise}
