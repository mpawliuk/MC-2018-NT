# Introduction to Number Theory - Math Circle 2018

**Instructor**: Micheal Pawliuk (University of Calgary)       
Summer 2018, Math Circle, Emory University       
**E-mail**: mpawliuk+MC@gmail.com    
**Class Hours**: M-Th 9-9:50 am (Lecture), 9:50-10:40 am (Problem Solving)

## Course Description:

This course will introduce students to elementary number theory. Students will first learn
basic logic and the structure of mathematical statements. Then they will proceed through 
number systems, divisibility theory, and modular arithmetic. The students will also learn some
applications of number theory such as solving Diophantine equations and RSA encryptions.

## Reference

This class will follow the schedule below and as a class we will build a mini-textbook together.

Students can also use the following resources:

* "Number Theory, A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories" by Pommersheim, Marks, and Flapan.
* The Number Theory Wikibook which is okay, but lacks motivation. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Discrete_Mathematics/Number_theory
